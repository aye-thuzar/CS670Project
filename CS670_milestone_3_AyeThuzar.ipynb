              " 'background': [\"<SOH> BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <EOH>A network interface device permits a subscriber to access a network. A passive optical network (PON) is an example of a network capable of delivering voice, video and other data among multiple network subscribers, using a common optical fiber link. Passive optical splitters and combiners enable multiple optical network terminals (ONTs) to share the optical fiber link. In a PON, each ONT terminates the optical fiber link for a residential or business subscriber, and is sometimes referred to as a subscriber premises node that delivers Fiber to the Premises (FTTP) services. An ONT is connected to one or more subscriber devices, such as televisions, set-top boxes, telephones, computers, or network appliances, which ultimately receive the voice, video and data delivered vii the PON. An ONT is an example of a network interface, device. Other examples of a network interface device, in different network types, include cable modems and digital subscriber line (DSL) boxes. Generally, a network also includes a network access interface. In a PON, the network access interface is sometimes referred to as an optical line terminator (OLT), having multiple, independent PON interface modules that serve multiple optical fiber links. A PON interface module provides an interface for transmission and reception of data packets over a particular optical fiber link that serves a group of ONTs. A PON is a downstream-multicast medium. Each packet transmitted on an optical fiber link can be received by every ONT served by that link. ONTs identify selected packets or frames on the fiber link based on addressing information included within the packets or frames. Network equipment, such as network interface devices, in a cable or hybrid network may be connected to power provided by a central office (CO), which commonly utilizes battery and generator back-up power to maintain a continuous power supply. In contrast, an ONT in an all-fiber optic network is ordinarily powered locally at the subscriber premises. For this reason, an ONT often includes a battery to provide backup power during a power outage to maintain critical services, such as voice service. Conventionally, the fibre of a PON typically terminates at a street cabinet to be shared by a number of subscriber equipment. The street cabinet houses an optical network terminal (ONT). The last few meters or kilometer from the street cabinet to a subscriber's home is typically bridged using existing twisted pair copper cables or radio links. The bandwidth resources of the fibre to the street cabinet are typically shared amongst a group of subscribers using an Ethernet switch. For example the fibre may extend to a street cabinet, a kerb outside a subscribers home, or directly into the subscribers home itself. Due to the bulkiness, size and complexity of the ONT cabinets are all factors that increase design difficulty and accrue additional costs. Also, the ONT itself is valuable, and its mounting on a wall, especially outside, makes it susceptible to theft or to being accidentally knocked down. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a compact optical network terminal to make passive optical networks seamlessly connected to regular computers and any other systems to overcome the above restrictions.\"],\n",

An ONT is connected to one or more subscriber devices, such as televisions, set-top boxes, telephones, computers, or network appliances, which ultimately receive the voice, video and data delivered vii the PON. An ONT is an example of a network interface, device. Other examples of a network interface device, in different network types, include cable modems and digital subscriber line (DSL) boxes. Generally, a network also includes a network access interface. In a PON, the network access interface is sometimes referred to as an optical line terminator (OLT), having multiple, independent PON interface modules that serve multiple optical fiber links. A PON interface module provides an interface for transmission and reception of data packets over a particular optical fiber link that serves a group of ONTs. A PON is a downstream-multicast medium. Each packet transmitted on an optical fiber link can be received by every ONT served by that link. ONTs identify selected packets or frames on the fiber link based on addressing information included within the packets or frames. Network equipment, such as network interface devices, in a cable or hybrid network may be connected to power provided by a central office (CO), which commonly utilizes battery and generator back-up power to maintain a continuous power supply. In contrast, an ONT in an all-fiber optic network is ordinarily powered locally at the subscriber premises. For this reason, an ONT often includes a battery to provide backup power during a power outage to maintain critical services, such as voice service. Conventionally, the fibre of a PON typically terminates at a street cabinet to be shared by a number of subscriber equipment. The street cabinet houses an optical network terminal (ONT). The last few meters or kilometer from the street cabinet to a subscriber's home is typically bridged using existing twisted pair copper cables or radio links. The bandwidth resources of the fibre to the street cabinet are typically shared amongst a group of subscribers using an Ethernet switch. For example the fibre may extend to a street cabinet, a kerb outside a subscribers home, or directly into the subscribers home itself. Due to the bulkiness, size and complexity of the ONT cabinets are all factors that increase design difficulty and accrue additional costs. Also, the ONT itself is valuable, and its mounting on a wall, especially outside, makes it susceptible to theft or to being accidentally knocked down. Therefore, it would be desirable to have a compact optical network terminal to make passive optical networks seamlessly connected to regular computers and any other systems to overcome the above restrictions.

A set is defined as a non-empty set including at least one element. FIG. 1A shows an optical network terminal (ONT) 100, which is an example of customer premises equipment (CPE), that connects a customer's communications equipment, e.g., computers, telephones, and televisions, to a telecommunications service provider. The ONT 100 includes an outer case 102 with an engagable cover 104 that covers a battery compartment (not shown) or another cavity of the ONT 100. A face 106 of the ONT 100 carries various connectors, including a power connector 108, coaxial cable connector 110, fiber optic cable connector 112, Ethernet (CAT-5) connector 114, and two telephone connectors 116. The ONT 100 transmits data to and receives data from a telecommunications network (not shown) via a fiber optic cable (not shown) connected to a fiber optic cable connector 112. Televisions, computers, and telephones on the customer's premises may be connected to the coaxial cable connector 110, Ethernet connector 114, and telephone connectors 116, respectively, on the ONT 100. FIG. 1B shows the ONT 100 of FIG. 1A with connector details with a bracket 120 attached to the outer case 102. The bracket 120 may be mounted to a wall (not shown), and the ONT 100 may be hung on the bracket. In many applications, the bracket 120 is installed on an exterior wall of a building or inside a garage, locations at which the ONT may be exposed to large temperature variations and different weather conditions. FIG. 2 shows a general Passive Optical Network (PON) Architecture. The elements of a PON are (i) Optical Line Terminal (OLT) 210 (ii) Passive Optical Splitter 220 and (iii) Optical Network Unit (ONU) 230. The Optical Line Terminal 210 is the main element of the network and is usually placed in the Local Exchange. It is a network element with PON line card, basically a aggregation switch. It works as an interface between core network and PON network. Optical Splitter 220 is a passive device with single input and multiple outputs. Optical power at input is split evenly between outputs. Not only signal travels from input to the outputs, signal can also travel from the output to the input. Splitters can be placed anywhere in between Central Office (CO) and Subscriber premises. It is used to connect an optical port of OLT with multiple subscribers. Optical Network units (ONUs) 230 serve as an interface to the network and are deployed at customer premises 240. It provides several interfaces for accessing triple play services and in the upper side it connects with the OLT via optical splitter. Although PONs can exist in three basic configuration (tree, bus and ring), the tree topology is favored due to smaller variation in the signal power from different end station. PON uses 1490 nm for the downstream wavelength and 1310 nm for the upstream wavelength. Signals are inserted or extracted from the fibre using a coarse wavelength division multiplexer (CWDM) filter at the CO and subscriber premises. FIG. 3 shows a compatible optical network terminal (ONT) according to one embodiment of the present invention. The optical network terminal (ONT) 300 includes a first interface 310, a second interface 320 and a middle region 330 sandwiched between the first and second interface. The first interface 310 coupled to a communications network 340, a second interface 320 coupled to a network client 350. The first interface is connected through a dedicated optical fiber link 360 (bi-directional) to receive optical signals from one or more communication network 340. The communication network may be or may include one or more but not limited to any of the xPON network 340 (e.g. of a broadband passive optical network (BPON), a gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON), an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), a gigabit-capable Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON), an active Ethernet optical network and any other future passive optical networks etc). The second interface 320 is coupled to the network client 350 though a USB port. In an operation, the middle region which may be a processor 330 including a memory (not shown in figure) coupled to the first interface 310 and to the second interface 320, wherein the processor 330 includes a circuitry which is configured for converting optical signals to electric signals, such that the network client can access the communications network. The first interface 310 may include an optical module (not shown in figure) which receives optical signals via the optical fiber link 360 and capable of converting the optical signals to electrical signals. The second interface 320 may include a control circuit (not shown in figure) which is capable of receiving the power from the network client 350 for processing the received electrical signals thereby reducing the required protocol processing time from the network client. Due to this behavior of the second interface 320 results in simplifying the ONT design by offloading the “non-volatile” part of the software to the network client 350 and downloading it on power to turn it. Most of the backend work can also be done by a software driver residing in the network client. Further, the second interface 320 acts as a network connectivity dongle with an optical transceiver at one end. Furthermore, the second interface may include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) jack which is couplable to Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug or connector of the network client 350. The second interface 320 capable of power up the “dongle” to connect it to the central office or Optical Line Terminal (OLT) by excluding external power source as required in the conventional design of ONT. In an example operation the Optical Network Terminal. (ONT) is connected to the network client through a USB port. Once the USB port of the network client 360 is coupled to the USB interface i.e. second interface 320, one or more driver needs to be installed at the network client 360 which then onwards controls the USB dongle (ONT) with the configured parameters at the installation time. The software boots up the USB dongle and communicates to network client 360 as a memory device with a built-in driver. The xPON protocol selected at the network client 360 will run and then converts the data coming from the WAN/LAN side to network client 360 as a network device. Once the software starts running in the network client 360, it would get connected to the OLT using the required xPON protocol. Once the network client 360 and the xPON network are connected, each network client 360 will have a dedicated connection (e.g. speed, bandwidth etc) as requested or selected by the client side. By this kind of novel and compatible design i.e. having xPON interface on one side and USB protocol interface on the other side will eradicate the necessity of the external power for the ONT. Also, by this kind of compatible design reduce the unnecessary splitting of equal upstream wavelength to all the network clients in the network. The network client may be or may include a host computer, a optical network unit, a optical network terminal or any other unit or terminal or device which is capable of accessing the passive optical network (xPON).

Accordingly, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration purpose only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. It is to be understood that the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a component surface” includes reference to one or more of such surfaces. By the term “substantially” it is meant that the recited characteristic, parameter, or value need not be achieved exactly, but that deviations or variations, including for example, tolerances, measurement error, measurement accuracy limitations and other factors known to those of skill in the art, may occur in amounts that do not preclude the effect the characteristic was intended to provide. FIGS. 1 through 4, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present disclosure in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way that would limit the scope of the disclosure. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged communications system. The terms used to describe various embodiments are exemplary. It should be understood that these are provided to merely aid the understanding of the description, and that their use and definitions in no way limit the scope of the invention. Terms first, second, and the like are used to differentiate between objects having the same terminology and are in no way intended to represent a chronological order, unless where explicitly stated otherwise. A set is defined as a non-empty set including at least one element. FIG. 1A shows an optical network terminal (ONT) 100, which is an example of customer premises equipment (CPE), that connects a customer's communications equipment, e.g., computers, telephones, and televisions, to a telecommunications service provider. The ONT 100 includes an outer case 102 with an engagable cover 104 that covers a battery compartment (not shown) or another cavity of the ONT 100. A face 106 of the ONT 100 carries various connectors, including a power connector 108, coaxial cable connector 110, fiber optic cable connector 112, Ethernet (CAT-5) connector 114, and two telephone connectors 116. The ONT 100 transmits data to and receives data from a telecommunications network (not shown) via a fiber optic cable (not shown) connected to a fiber optic cable connector 112. Televisions, computers, and telephones on the customer's premises may be connected to the coaxial cable connector 110, Ethernet connector 114, and telephone connectors 116, respectively, on the ONT 100. FIG. 1B shows the ONT 100 of FIG. 1A with connector details with a bracket 120 attached to the outer case 102. The bracket 120 may be mounted to a wall (not shown), and the ONT 100 may be hung on the bracket. In many applications, the bracket 120 is installed on an exterior wall of a building or inside a garage, locations at which the ONT may be exposed to large temperature variations and different weather conditions. FIG. 2 shows a general Passive Optical Network (PON) Architecture. The elements of a PON are (i) Optical Line Terminal (OLT) 210 (ii) Passive Optical Splitter 220 and (iii) Optical Network Unit (ONU) 230. The Optical Line Terminal 210 is the main element of the network and is usually placed in the Local Exchange. It is a network element with PON line card, basically a aggregation switch. It works as an interface between core network and PON network. Optical Splitter 220 is a passive device with single input and multiple outputs. Optical power at input is split evenly between outputs. Not only signal travels from input to the outputs, signal can also travel from the output to the input. Splitters can be placed anywhere in between Central Office (CO) and Subscriber premises. It is used to connect an optical port of OLT with multiple subscribers. Optical Network units (ONUs) 230 serve as an interface to the network and are deployed at customer premises 240. It provides several interfaces for accessing triple play services and in the upper side it connects with the OLT via optical splitter. Although PONs can exist in three basic configuration (tree, bus and ring), the tree topology is favored due to smaller variation in the signal power from different end station. PON uses 1490 nm for the downstream wavelength and 1310 nm for the upstream wavelength. Signals are inserted or extracted from the fibre using a coarse wavelength division multiplexer (CWDM) filter at the CO and subscriber premises. FIG. 3 shows a compatible optical network terminal (ONT) according to one embodiment of the present invention. The optical network terminal (ONT) 300 includes a first interface 310, a second interface 320 and a middle region 330 sandwiched between the first and second interface. The first interface 310 coupled to a communications network 340, a second interface 320 coupled to a network client 350. The first interface is connected through a dedicated optical fiber link 360 (bi-directional) to receive optical signals from one or more communication network 340. The communication network may be or may include one or more but not limited to any of the xPON network 340 (e.g. of a broadband passive optical network (BPON), a gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON), an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), a gigabit-capable Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON), an active Ethernet optical network and any other future passive optical networks etc). The second interface 320 is coupled to the network client 350 though a USB port. In an operation, the middle region which may be a processor 330 including a memory (not shown in figure) coupled to the first interface 310 and to the second interface 320, wherein the processor 330 includes a circuitry which is configured for converting optical signals to electric signals, such that the network client can access the communications network. The first interface 310 may include an optical module (not shown in figure) which receives optical signals via the optical fiber link 360 and capable of converting the optical signals to electrical signals. The second interface 320 may include a control circuit (not shown in figure) which is capable of receiving the power from the network client 350 for processing the received electrical signals thereby reducing the required protocol processing time from the network client. Due to this behavior of the second interface 320 results in simplifying the ONT design by offloading the “non-volatile” part of the software to the network client 350 and downloading it on power to turn it. Most of the backend work can also be done by a software driver residing in the network client. Further, the second interface 320 acts as a network connectivity dongle with an optical transceiver at one end. Furthermore, the second interface may include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) jack which is couplable to Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug or connector of the network client 350. The second interface 320 capable of power up the “dongle” to connect it to the central office or Optical Line Terminal (OLT) by excluding external power source as required in the conventional design of ONT. In an example operation the Optical Network Terminal. (ONT) is connected to the network client through a USB port. Once the USB port of the network client 360 is coupled to the USB interface i.e. second interface 320, one or more driver needs to be installed at the network client 360 which then onwards controls the USB dongle (ONT) with the configured parameters at the installation time. The software boots up the USB dongle and communicates to network client 360 as a memory device with a built-in driver. The xPON protocol selected at the network client 360 will run and then converts the data coming from the WAN/LAN side to network client 360 as a network device. Once the software starts running in the network client 360, it would get connected to the OLT using the required xPON protocol. Once the network client 360 and the xPON network are connected, each network client 360 will have a dedicated connection (e.g. speed, bandwidth etc) as requested or selected by the client side. By this kind of novel and compatible design i.e. having xPON interface on one side and USB protocol interface on the other side will eradicate the necessity of the external power for the ONT. Also, by this kind of compatible design reduce the unnecessary splitting of equal upstream wavelength to all the network clients in the network. The network client may be or may include a host computer, a optical network unit, a optical network terminal or any other unit or terminal or device which is capable of accessing the passive optical network (xPON).

Accordingly, it should be apparent to those skilled in the art that the following description of exemplary embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration purpose only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. It is to be understood that the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a component surface” includes reference to one or more of such surfaces. By the term “substantially” it is meant that the recited characteristic, parameter, or value need not be achieved exactly, but that deviations or variations, including for example, tolerances, measurement error, measurement accuracy limitations and other factors known to those of skill in the art, may occur in amounts that do not preclude the effect the characteristic was intended to provide. FIGS. 1 through 4, discussed below, and the various embodiments used to describe the principles of the present disclosure in this patent document are by way of illustration only and should not be construed in any way that would limit the scope of the disclosure. Those skilled in the art will understand that the principles of the present disclosure may be implemented in any suitably arranged communications system. The terms used to describe various embodiments are exemplary. It should be understood that these are provided to merely aid the understanding of the description, and that their use and definitions in no way limit the scope of the invention. Terms first, second, and the like are used to differentiate between objects having the same terminology and are in no way intended to represent a chronological order, unless where explicitly stated otherwise. A set is defined as a non-empty set including at least one element. FIG. 1A shows an optical network terminal (ONT) 100, which is an example of customer premises equipment (CPE), that connects a customer's communications equipment, e.g., computers, telephones, and televisions, to a telecommunications service provider. The ONT 100 includes an outer case 102 with an engagable cover 104 that covers a battery compartment (not shown) or another cavity of the ONT 100. A face 106 of the ONT 100 carries various connectors, including a power connector 108, coaxial cable connector 110, fiber optic cable connector 112, Ethernet (CAT-5) connector 114, and two telephone connectors 116. The ONT 100 transmits data to and receives data from a telecommunications network (not shown) via a fiber optic cable (not shown) connected to a fiber optic cable connector 112. Televisions, computers, and telephones on the customer's premises may be connected to the coaxial cable connector 110, Ethernet connector 114, and telephone connectors 116, respectively, on the ONT 100. FIG. 1B shows the ONT 100 of FIG. 1A with connector details with a bracket 120 attached to the outer case 102. The bracket 120 may be mounted to a wall (not shown), and the ONT 100 may be hung on the bracket. In many applications, the bracket 120 is installed on an exterior wall of a building or inside a garage, locations at which the ONT may be exposed to large temperature variations and different weather conditions. FIG. 2 shows a general Passive Optical Network (PON) Architecture. The elements of a PON are (i) Optical Line Terminal (OLT) 210 (ii) Passive Optical Splitter 220 and (iii) Optical Network Unit (ONU) 230. The Optical Line Terminal 210 is the main element of the network and is usually placed in the Local Exchange. It is a network element with PON line card, basically a aggregation switch. It works as an interface between core network and PON network. Optical Splitter 220 is a passive device with single input and multiple outputs. Optical power at input is split evenly between outputs. Not only signal travels from input to the outputs, signal can also travel from the output to the input. Splitters can be placed anywhere in between Central Office (CO) and Subscriber premises. It is used to connect an optical port of OLT with multiple subscribers. Optical Network units (ONUs) 230 serve as an interface to the network and are deployed at customer premises 240. It provides several interfaces for accessing triple play services and in the upper side it connects with the OLT via optical splitter. Although PONs can exist in three basic configuration (tree, bus and ring), the tree topology is favored due to smaller variation in the signal power from different end station. PON uses 1490 nm for the downstream wavelength and 1310 nm for the upstream wavelength. Signals are inserted or extracted from the fibre using a coarse wavelength division multiplexer (CWDM) filter at the CO and subscriber premises. FIG. 3 shows a compatible optical network terminal (ONT) according to one embodiment of the present invention. The optical network terminal (ONT) 300 includes a first interface 310, a second interface 320 and a middle region 330 sandwiched between the first and second interface. The first interface 310 coupled to a communications network 340, a second interface 320 coupled to a network client 350. The first interface is connected through a dedicated optical fiber link 360 (bi-directional) to receive optical signals from one or more communication network 340. The communication network may be or may include one or more but not limited to any of the xPON network 340 (e.g. of a broadband passive optical network (BPON), a gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON), an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), a gigabit-capable Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON), an active Ethernet optical network and any other future passive optical networks etc). The second interface 320 is coupled to the network client 350 though a USB port. In an operation, the middle region which may be a processor 330 including a memory (not shown in figure) coupled to the first interface 310 and to the second interface 320, wherein the processor 330 includes a circuitry which is configured for converting optical signals to electric signals, such that the network client can access the communications network. The first interface 310 may include an optical module (not shown in figure) which receives optical signals via the optical fiber link 360 and capable of converting the optical signals to electrical signals. The second interface 320 may include a control circuit (not shown in figure) which is capable of receiving the power from the network client 350 for processing the received electrical signals thereby reducing the required protocol processing time from the network client. Due to this behavior of the second interface 320 results in simplifying the ONT design by offloading the “non-volatile” part of the software to the network client 350 and downloading it on power to turn it. Most of the backend work can also be done by a software driver residing in the network client. Further, the second interface 320 acts as a network connectivity dongle with an optical transceiver at one end. Furthermore, the second interface may include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) jack which is couplable to Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug or connector of the network client 350. The second interface 320 capable of power up the “dongle” to connect it to the central office or Optical Line Terminal (OLT) by excluding external power source as required in the conventional design of ONT. In an example operation the Optical Network Terminal. (ONT) is connected to the network client through a USB port. Once the USB port of the network client 360 is coupled to the USB interface i.e. second interface 320, one or more driver needs to be installed at the network client 360 which then onwards controls the USB dongle (ONT) with the configured parameters at the installation time. The software boots up the USB dongle and communicates to network client 360 as a memory device with a built-in driver. The xPON protocol selected at the network client 360 will run and then converts the data coming from the WAN/LAN side to network client 360 as a network device. Once the software starts running in the network client 360, it would get connected to the OLT using the required xPON protocol. Once the network client 360 and the xPON network are connected, each network client 360 will have a dedicated connection (e.g. speed, bandwidth etc) as requested or selected by the client side. By this kind of novel and compatible design i.e. having xPON interface on one side and USB protocol interface on the other side will eradicate the necessity of the external power for the ONT. Also, by this kind of compatible design reduce the unnecessary splitting of equal upstream wavelength to all the network clients in the network. The network client may be or may include a host computer, a optical network unit, a optical network terminal or any other unit or terminal or device which is capable of accessing the passive optical network (xPON).

Terms first, second, and the like are used to differentiate between objects having the same terminology and are in no way intended to represent a chronological order, unless where explicitly stated otherwise. A set is defined as a non-empty set including at least one element. FIG. 1A shows an optical network terminal (ONT) 100, which is an example of customer premises equipment (CPE), that connects a customer's communications equipment, e.g., computers, telephones, and televisions, to a telecommunications service provider. The ONT 100 includes an outer case 102 with an engagable cover 104 that covers a battery compartment (not shown) or another cavity of the ONT 100. A face 106 of the ONT 100 carries various connectors, including a power connector 108, coaxial cable connector 110, fiber optic cable connector 112, Ethernet (CAT-5) connector 114, and two telephone connectors 116. The ONT 100 transmits data to and receives data from a telecommunications network (not shown) via a fiber optic cable (not shown) connected to a fiber optic cable connector 112. Televisions, computers, and telephones on the customer's premises may be connected to the coaxial cable connector 110, Ethernet connector 114, and telephone connectors 116, respectively, on the ONT 100. FIG. 1B shows the ONT 100 of FIG. 1A with connector details with a bracket 120 attached to the outer case 102. The bracket 120 may be mounted to a wall (not shown), and the ONT 100 may be hung on the bracket. In many applications, the bracket 120 is installed on an exterior wall of a building or inside a garage, locations at which the ONT may be exposed to large temperature variations and different weather conditions. FIG. 2 shows a general Passive Optical Network (PON) Architecture. The elements of a PON are (i) Optical Line Terminal (OLT) 210 (ii) Passive Optical Splitter 220 and (iii) Optical Network Unit (ONU) 230. The Optical Line Terminal 210 is the main element of the network and is usually placed in the Local Exchange. It is a network element with PON line card, basically a aggregation switch. It works as an interface between core network and PON network. Optical Splitter 220 is a passive device with single input and multiple outputs. Optical power at input is split evenly between outputs. Not only signal travels from input to the outputs, signal can also travel from the output to the input. Splitters can be placed anywhere in between Central Office (CO) and Subscriber premises. It is used to connect an optical port of OLT with multiple subscribers. Optical Network units (ONUs) 230 serve as an interface to the network and are deployed at customer premises 240. It provides several interfaces for accessing triple play services and in the upper side it connects with the OLT via optical splitter. Although PONs can exist in three basic configuration (tree, bus and ring), the tree topology is favored due to smaller variation in the signal power from different end station. PON uses 1490 nm for the downstream wavelength and 1310 nm for the upstream wavelength. Signals are inserted or extracted from the fibre using a coarse wavelength division multiplexer (CWDM) filter at the CO and subscriber premises. FIG. 3 shows a compatible optical network terminal (ONT) according to one embodiment of the present invention. The optical network terminal (ONT) 300 includes a first interface 310, a second interface 320 and a middle region 330 sandwiched between the first and second interface. The first interface 310 coupled to a communications network 340, a second interface 320 coupled to a network client 350. The first interface is connected through a dedicated optical fiber link 360 (bi-directional) to receive optical signals from one or more communication network 340. The communication network may be or may include one or more but not limited to any of the xPON network 340 (e.g. of a broadband passive optical network (BPON), a gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON), an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), a gigabit-capable Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON), an active Ethernet optical network and any other future passive optical networks etc). The second interface 320 is coupled to the network client 350 though a USB port. In an operation, the middle region which may be a processor 330 including a memory (not shown in figure) coupled to the first interface 310 and to the second interface 320, wherein the processor 330 includes a circuitry which is configured for converting optical signals to electric signals, such that the network client can access the communications network. The first interface 310 may include an optical module (not shown in figure) which receives optical signals via the optical fiber link 360 and capable of converting the optical signals to electrical signals. The second interface 320 may include a control circuit (not shown in figure) which is capable of receiving the power from the network client 350 for processing the received electrical signals thereby reducing the required protocol processing time from the network client. Due to this behavior of the second interface 320 results in simplifying the ONT design by offloading the “non-volatile” part of the software to the network client 350 and downloading it on power to turn it. Most of the backend work can also be done by a software driver residing in the network client. Further, the second interface 320 acts as a network connectivity dongle with an optical transceiver at one end. Furthermore, the second interface may include a Universal Serial Bus (USB) jack which is couplable to Universal Serial Bus (USB) plug or connector of the network client 350. The second interface 320 capable of power up the “dongle” to connect it to the central office or Optical Line Terminal (OLT) by excluding external power source as required in the conventional design of ONT. In an example operation the Optical Network Terminal. (ONT) is connected to the network client through a USB port. Once the USB port of the network client 360 is coupled to the USB interface i.e. second interface 320, one or more driver needs to be installed at the network client 360 which then onwards controls the USB dongle (ONT) with the configured parameters at the installation time. The software boots up the USB dongle and communicates to network client 360 as a memory device with a built-in driver. The xPON protocol selected at the network client 360 will run and then converts the data coming from the WAN/LAN side to network client 360 as a network device. Once the software starts running in the network client 360, it would get connected to the OLT using the required xPON protocol. Once the network client 360 and the xPON network are connected, each network client 360 will have a dedicated connection (e.g. speed, bandwidth etc) as requested or selected by the client side. By this kind of novel and compatible design i.e. having xPON interface on one side and USB protocol interface on the other side will eradicate the necessity of the external power for the ONT. Also, by this kind of compatible design reduce the unnecessary splitting of equal upstream wavelength to all the network clients in the network. The network client may be or may include a host computer, a optical network unit, a optical network terminal or any other unit or terminal or device which is capable of accessing the passive optical network (xPON).

FIGS. 1-4 illustrate various embodiments of the invention that can be understood and appropriately carried out by those of ordinary skill in the art. In the foregoing detailed description of embodiments of the invention, various features are grouped together in a single embodiment for the purpose of streamlining the disclosure. This method of disclosure is not to be interpreted as reflecting an intention that the claimed embodiments of the invention require more features than are expressly recited in each claim. Rather, as the following claims reflect, inventive subject matter lies in less than all features of a single disclosed embodiment. Thus, the following claims are hereby incorporated into the detailed description of embodiments of the invention, with each claim standing on its own as a separate embodiment. It is understood that the above description is intended to be illustrative, and not restrictive. It is intended to cover all alternatives, modifications and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims. Many other embodiments will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reviewing the above description. The scope of the invention should, therefore, be determined with reference to the appended claims, along with the full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled. In the appended claims, the terms “including” and “in which” are used as the plain-English equivalents of the respective terms “comprising” and “wherein,” respectively.\"],\n",
