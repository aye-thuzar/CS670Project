## Finetuning Language Models - Can I Patent This?

The USPTO is the US Patent and Trademark Office. It is the agency that grants patents to inventors and businesses for their inventions.

You are fired by USPTO to work on introducting AI into the organization. You are told that USPTO is facing patent examiner staff and budget shortages and to help the organization you are tasked to create an app that will accept an input patent application and will return its patentability score. The app will be made available to the public and will be used by patent applicants to determine the patentability of their inventions before they file their patent applications, therefore reducing the workload of the patent examiners.
